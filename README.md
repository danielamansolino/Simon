# Simon 
## Description
Simon is a memory game in which the computer generates a sequence of sounds and colors and requires the player to repeat the sequence. If the player succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer adding one extra color in each round. Once the user does not match the same sequence of the computer the game is over. In this version of the game you become a winner by following the sequences five times successfully. To restart the game you may press the 'Play Again' button.
